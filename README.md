## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Well I think the `picture` tag when you have to use different pictures or in this case cropped images using the `source` tag inside the `picture` tag. With the `source` tag you can commend the browser which image you would like to load in what condition like in a breakpoint like with media query inside the `source` tag as an attribute `media="(min-width: 37.5rem)`

```html
<!-- Item Picture -->
      <picture class="item-image">
        <source srcset="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg" media="(min-width: 37.5rem)">
        <img src="./images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum" loading="eager"
          decoding="sync">
      </picture>
```

### Continued development

I still need to practice and used to about sizes form `px` to `rem` or `em`.

### Useful resources

- [PX to REM converter](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - This helped me convert the sizes from one measure to another one.
- [Web Dev - Responsive Design](https://web.dev/learn/design/welcome) - This is a nice learning platform where you can learn about responsive design.
